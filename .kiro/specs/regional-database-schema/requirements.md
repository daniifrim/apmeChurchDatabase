# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the APME Church Database System to properly model the hierarchical relationship between churches, counties (judete), and regional administrative units (RCCP). Currently, churches are only linked to counties via text fields, but the system needs to support the organizational structure where counties belong to specific RCCP regions for better church management and reporting.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to organize churches by their proper administrative hierarchy (RCCP → County → Church), so that I can generate regional reports and manage churches by administrative regions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing church data THEN the system SHALL display the church's county and its corresponding RCCP region
2. WHEN filtering churches THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by RCCP region and county
3. WHEN creating reports THEN the system SHALL group churches by RCCP region and county
4. WHEN importing church data THEN the system SHALL automatically associate churches with their correct county and RCCP region

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a missionary, I want to see which RCCP region and county a church belongs to, so that I can understand the administrative context and coordinate with the appropriate regional leadership.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing church details THEN the system SHALL display the county name and RCCP region
2. WHEN creating visit reports THEN the system SHALL automatically include regional context
3. WHEN searching for churches THEN the system SHALL allow searching by county or RCCP region
4. WHEN viewing church lists THEN the system SHALL show county and region information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to maintain accurate county and RCCP region data, so that the organizational hierarchy remains current and churches are properly categorized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing counties THEN the system SHALL allow CRUD operations on county records
2. WHEN managing RCCP regions THEN the system SHALL allow CRUD operations on region records
3. WHEN updating county-region relationships THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity
4. IF a county or region is deleted THEN the system SHALL prevent deletion if churches are associated
5. WHEN importing new data THEN the system SHALL validate county and region relationships

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to generate reports grouped by RCCP regions and counties, so that I can analyze church distribution and engagement patterns across administrative boundaries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating regional reports THEN the system SHALL group data by RCCP region
2. WHEN generating county reports THEN the system SHALL group data by county within regions
3. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL include county and RCCP region information
4. WHEN viewing analytics dashboards THEN the system SHALL display regional and county-level metrics
5. WHEN comparing regions THEN the system SHALL provide comparative statistics across RCCP regions
