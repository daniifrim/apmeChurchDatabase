# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The APME Church Database System needs to be refactored from a traditional Express.js server architecture to a serverless architecture compatible with Vercel deployment. Currently, the application uses session-based authentication, persistent server state, and a monolithic Express server that is incompatible with Vercel's serverless functions. This migration will enable scalable, cost-effective deployment while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to deploy successfully on Vercel's serverless platform, so that we can benefit from automatic scaling and reduced infrastructure costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed to Vercel THEN all API endpoints SHALL respond correctly without server errors
2. WHEN a user makes an API request THEN the serverless function SHALL initialize and respond within acceptable time limits
3. WHEN multiple concurrent requests are made THEN each serverless function SHALL handle requests independently without state conflicts
4. WHEN the application is idle THEN it SHALL not consume server resources (true serverless behavior)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to restructure the API routes into individual serverless functions, so that each endpoint can be deployed and scaled independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API routes are restructured THEN each endpoint SHALL be a separate serverless function file
2. WHEN a client makes a request to `/api/churches` THEN it SHALL be handled by `api/churches/index.ts`
3. WHEN a client makes a request to `/api/churches/:id` THEN it SHALL be handled by `api/churches/[id].ts`
4. WHEN authentication endpoints are called THEN they SHALL be handled by separate functions in `api/auth/`
5. WHEN the old monolithic routes are removed THEN all existing functionality SHALL remain intact

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate and maintain my session across requests, so that I don't have to log in repeatedly while using the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN they SHALL receive a JWT token for authentication
2. WHEN a user makes authenticated requests THEN the JWT token SHALL be validated on each request
3. WHEN a JWT token expires THEN the user SHALL be prompted to log in again
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN their JWT token SHALL be invalidated
5. WHEN the session-based authentication is removed THEN all existing auth functionality SHALL work with JWT tokens

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system, I want to handle database connections efficiently in a serverless environment, so that cold starts are minimized and connection limits are respected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a serverless function starts THEN it SHALL establish a database connection efficiently
2. WHEN multiple functions run concurrently THEN they SHALL not exceed database connection limits
3. WHEN a function completes THEN database connections SHALL be properly closed or reused
4. WHEN the application experiences high traffic THEN database connection pooling SHALL prevent connection exhaustion
5. WHEN using Supabase client THEN all database operations SHALL work correctly in serverless functions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain backward compatibility with the existing frontend, so that minimal changes are required to the React application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend is refactored THEN all existing API endpoints SHALL maintain the same request/response format
2. WHEN the frontend makes API calls THEN they SHALL work without modification (except auth headers)
3. WHEN authentication changes are made THEN the existing AuthContext SHALL be updated to handle JWT tokens
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing frontend functionality SHALL work without breaking changes
5. WHEN users interact with the application THEN they SHALL not notice any difference in functionality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling and logging in the serverless environment, so that I can monitor and debug issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN serverless functions encounter errors THEN they SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes
2. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient detail for debugging
3. WHEN functions experience cold starts THEN performance metrics SHALL be tracked
4. WHEN database operations fail THEN errors SHALL be handled gracefully with user-friendly messages
5. WHEN the application is deployed THEN monitoring and alerting SHALL be configured for production use

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain the existing development workflow, so that local development remains efficient and familiar.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing locally THEN the application SHALL run with `npm run dev` as before
2. WHEN making changes THEN hot reloading SHALL work for both frontend and backend
3. WHEN testing API endpoints THEN they SHALL be accessible at the same local URLs
4. WHEN debugging THEN source maps and error traces SHALL be available
5. WHEN the serverless structure is implemented THEN local development SHALL simulate the production environment accurately
