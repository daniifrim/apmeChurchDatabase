## Phase 4: Core Product Features (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Based on**: July 29 stakeholder meeting requirements

### 4.1 Data Import Pipeline
**Requirement**: Import ~6000 churches from APME Excel files**
Tasks**:
- [ ] Create Excel import utility (`server/importChurches.ts`)
- [ ] Validate and clean imported data
- [ ] Handle duplicate church entries
- [ ] Import historical visit data from Romiscon 2021-2025
- [ ] Create admin interface for data review and approval

**Data Sources**:
- APME's existing Excel files (~6000 churches)
- Regional Pentecostal leadership updated lists
- Historical Romiscon conference data (2021-2025)

### 4.2 Enhanced Church Data Schema
**Current Gap**: Meeting identified missing fields

**Schema Updates Needed**:
```sql
-- Add to churches table
ALTER TABLE churches ADD COLUMN postal_code VARCHAR(10);
ALTER TABLE churches ADD COLUMN pastor_name VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE churches ADD COLUMN pastor_phone VARCHAR(20);
ALTER TABLE churches ADD COLUMN pastor_email VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE churches ADD COLUMN membership_count INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE churches ADD COLUMN denomination VARCHAR(100);
ALTER TABLE churches ADD COLUMN last_updated TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW();
ALTER TABLE churches ADD COLUMN data_source VARCHAR(50); -- 'excel_import', 'manual', 'regional_update'
```

### 4.3 Visit Rating System
**Requirement**: Missionaries rate church engagement and hospitality

**New Database Tables**:
```sql
-- Visit ratings table
CREATE TABLE visit_ratings (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  visit_id INTEGER REFERENCES visits(id),
  hospitality_rating INTEGER CHECK (hospitality_rating >= 1 AND hospitality_rating <= 5),
  engagement_rating INTEGER CHECK (engagement_rating >= 1 AND engagement_rating <= 5),
  attendance_rating INTEGER CHECK (attendance_rating >= 1 AND attendance_rating <= 5),
  offerings_collected DECIMAL(10,2),
  follow_up_required BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Church engagement scores (aggregated)
CREATE TABLE church_engagement_scores (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  church_id INTEGER REFERENCES churches(id),
  avg_hospitality DECIMAL(3,2),
  avg_engagement DECIMAL(3,2),
  avg_attendance DECIMAL(3,2),
  total_visits INTEGER,
  last_calculated TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
