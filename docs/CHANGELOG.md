### Visit Form UX Improvements: Dropdown Ratings and Simplified Fields

-   **Dropdown Ratings**: Converted mission openness and hospitality from star rating buttons to dropdown selectors with clear options like "1 - Resistent", "2 - Interes minim", etc.
-   **Clear Descriptions**: Each dropdown selection shows full Romanian description below the field, improving user understanding of rating criteria.
-   **Simplified Data Entry**: Removed "Numărul de membri" (church member count) field to reduce form complexity and focus on essential visit data.
-   **Updated Calculations**: Modified financial score calculation to use only per-attendee ratios instead of member-based calculations.
-   **Better Visual Hierarchy**: Added Clock icon to visit duration field for consistency with other form elements.
-   **Impact**: Streamlined form reduces confusion about rating meanings and makes the evaluation process more intuitive for users.

### Enhanced Visit Logging with Integrated Church Rating System

-   **Combined Workflow**: Transformed two-step process into single form allowing visit logging with optional comprehensive church rating.
-   **Romanian-Specific Criteria**: Implemented dropdown-based rating system with Romanian descriptions for "Deschidere generală pentru misiune" and "Ospitalitate" (1-5 scale).
-   **Financial Tracking**: Added fields for offerings amount, church member count, and missionary support tracking with automatic per-person ratio calculations.
-   **Real-Time Preview**: Added live star rating calculation (1-5 stars) that updates as users fill rating fields using weighted formula (mission openness 35%, hospitality 25%, financial 25%, missionary bonus 15%).
-   **Database Enhancement**: Extended `visit_ratings` table schema with `attendees_count` column and updated all related APIs and storage methods.
-   **Atomic Transactions**: Backend creates visit and rating records in single transaction, ensuring data consistency and setting `isRated: true` when ratings provided.
-   **Progressive Disclosure**: Expandable rating section maintains clean UX while providing comprehensive evaluation capabilities.
-   **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains support for visit-only submissions while encouraging rating completion.
-   **Impact**: Significantly improved data collection rate for church evaluations by integrating rating into natural visit workflow, supporting data-driven missionary outreach decisions.
