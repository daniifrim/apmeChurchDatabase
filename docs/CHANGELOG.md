### Version 2.0 Rating System: Visit Form Logic Fix

#### üêõ Critical Inconsistency Resolved
- **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: VisitForm.tsx was still using Version 1.0 rating calculation despite backend implementing Version 2.0
- **OLD LOGIC**: Using 35% mission, 25% hospitality, 25% financial, 15% missionary bonus with missionary support in star calculation
- **ROOT CAUSE**: Visit form was not updated during the Version 2.0 refactoring process
- **USER IMPACT**: Users seeing inconsistent rating calculations between form preview and actual stored ratings

#### ‚úÖ Version 2.0 Implementation Applied
- **DYNAMIC WEIGHTING**: Implemented correct 40% mission openness, 30% hospitality, 30% financial generosity base weights
- **WEIGHT REDISTRIBUTION**: When no offering made, financial weight redistributes to 56.5% mission openness, 43.5% hospitality
- **MISSIONARY SUPPORT SEPARATION**: Removed missionary support from star rating calculation, displayed as separate church-level badge
- **UI CONSISTENCY**: Updated preview to show "Visit Rating" with missionary support as separate "Sus»õine X misionari" badge
- **VERSION CLARITY**: Added clear indication that Version 2.0 system is in use

#### üéØ Technical Implementation
- **CALCULATION LOGIC**: Now matches backend Version 2.0 specification exactly
- **PREVIEW ACCURACY**: Real-time rating preview now matches what gets stored in database
- **USER EXPERIENCE**: Clear separation between visit-specific ratings and church-level attributes
- **TYPE SAFETY**: All changes pass TypeScript compilation without errors

#### üìä Impact
- **RATING CONSISTENCY**: Visit form preview now matches backend calculation logic
- **USER TRUST**: Eliminates confusion from inconsistent rating displays
- **SYSTEM INTEGRITY**: Complete Version 2.0 implementation across frontend and backend
- **DATA ACCURACY**: Ensures all new visit ratings use correct Version 2.0 formula

### Status: ‚úÖ VERSION 2.0 RATING SYSTEM FULLY CONSISTENT - VISIT FORM FIXED

### CORS Policy Fix: Visits API Loading Error Resolution

#### üîß Critical CORS Error Fixed
- **ROOT CAUSE**: Frontend using `credentials: 'include'` with API returning `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` (wildcard)
- **CORS VIOLATION**: CORS policy prohibits wildcard origin when credentials are included
- **ERROR MESSAGE**: "Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: The value of the 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header in the response must not be the wildcard '*' when the request's credentials mode is 'include'"

#### ‚úÖ Solution Applied
- **DEV SERVER CORS**: Updated `server/dev-serverless.ts` CORS headers from `*` to `http://localhost:5173`
- **CREDENTIALS SUPPORT**: Added `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` header
- **UTILITY CORS**: Updated `lib/utils.ts` CORS configuration for consistency
- **SERVER RESTART**: Restarted development server to apply new CORS configuration

#### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details
- **OPTIONS REQUEST**: Now returns correct origin-specific headers for preflight requests
- **CREDENTIALS MODE**: Frontend can safely use `credentials: 'include'` for session-based auth
- **AUTH BYPASS**: Development mode auth bypass working correctly with new CORS setup
- **API COMPATIBILITY**: All existing API endpoints continue to work with updated CORS

#### üìä Impact
- **VISITS LOADING**: `/api/visits` endpoint now loads successfully in frontend
- **CROSS-ORIGIN**: Proper cross-origin requests between localhost:5173 and localhost:3000
- **AUTH FLOW**: Session-based authentication working correctly across origins
- **USER EXPERIENCE**: Visits page now displays data without CORS errors

### Status: ‚úÖ CORS ISSUE RESOLVED - VISITS API OPERATIONAL

-   **Financial Tracking**: Added fields for offerings amount, church member count, and missionary support tracking with automatic per-person ratio calculations.
-   **Real-Time Preview**: Added live star rating calculation (1-5 stars) that updates as users fill rating fields using weighted formula (mission openness 35%, hospitality 25%, financial 25%, missionary bonus 15%).
-   **Database Enhancement**: Extended `visit_ratings` table schema with `attendees_count` column and updated all related APIs and storage methods.
-   **Atomic Transactions**: Backend creates visit and rating records in single transaction, ensuring data consistency and setting `isRated: true` when ratings provided.
-   **Progressive Disclosure**: Expandable rating section maintains clean UX while providing comprehensive evaluation capabilities.
-   **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains support for visit-only submissions while encouraging rating completion.
-   **Impact**: Significantly improved data collection rate for church evaluations by integrating rating into natural visit workflow, supporting data-driven missionary outreach decisions.

### Diacritic-Insensitive Search Implementation

-   **Feature**: Added Romanian diacritic normalization to search functionality across ListView and VisitsView.
-   **Backend**: Enhanced `getChurches` method with client-side diacritic-insensitive filtering for search queries.
-   **Frontend**: Improved ListView with debounced search (300ms) and better loading states during search.
-   **Utility**: Created `normalizeDiacritics` function that handles Romanian characters: ƒÉ, √¢, √Æ, »ô, »õ.
-   **User Experience**: Users can search for "sfanta" or "sf√¢nta" and get the same results for church names like "Sf√¢nta Maria".
-   **Impact**: Significantly improved search usability for Romanian users who may not have easy access to diacritic characters.
