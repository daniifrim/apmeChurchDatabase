- Replaced Replit authentication with Supabase auth middleware
- Updated database connection to use postgres-js driver
- Created hybrid auth system supporting both Supabase and fallback hardcoded login

## 2025-01-31 - Phase 3 Frontend Integration: Critical Issues Identified

### Current Status: RESOLVED - Database Connection Working via Supabase Client

### Critical Issues Encountered

#### 1. Database Connection Failure
**Error**: `PostgresError: Tenant or user not found`
**Impact**: Complete API failure - no database operations working
**Root Cause**: Connection string format incompatibility between postgres-js driver and Supabase pooler

**Details**:
- Drizzle ORM with postgres-js cannot connect to Supabase pooler
- Connection string: `postgresql://postgres.znoqcfyvnmgtptsimvcm:Psalm1%3A3%23@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres`
- Tried multiple connection configurations (SSL, prepare: false, different ports)
- MCP Supabase connection works fine, indicating credentials are correct

#### 2. Vite Middleware Route Interference
**Error**: API routes returning HTML instead of JSON
**Impact**: All API endpoints inaccessible during development
**Root Cause**: Vite catch-all middleware intercepting API routes

**Resolution Applied**:
- Modified `server/vite.ts` to skip API routes in catch-all handler
- Added condition: `if (url.startsWith('/api')) return next()`

#### 3. Environment Variable Loading Issues
**Error**: `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` not loading properly
**Impact**: Supabase client initialization failures
**Root Cause**: .env file format inconsistencies

**Resolution Applied**:
- Rewrote .env file without quotes
- Verified environment variables are now loading correctly

#### 4. Node.js Version Compatibility
**Warning**: `Node.js 18 and below are deprecated for @supabase/supabase-js`
**Impact**: Future compatibility issues
**Current Status**: Functional but deprecated

### Files Modified During Troubleshooting
- `server/db.ts` - Multiple connection configuration attempts
- `server/vite.ts` - Fixed API route interference, Node.js compatibility
- `server/storage.ts` - Added database connection testing methods
- `server/routes.ts` - Added `/api/test-db` endpoint for diagnostics
- `.env` - Reformatted multiple times to fix loading issues
- `client/index.html` - Removed Replit banner script
- `vite.config.ts` - Removed Replit dependencies

### Resolution Status
- ‚úÖ Environment variables loading correctly
- ‚úÖ API routes accessible (not intercepted by Vite)
- ‚úÖ Supabase client connection working with anon key
- ‚úÖ Database test endpoint returning data successfully
- ‚úÖ Test user created and accessible via API
- ‚ùå Drizzle ORM postgres-js connection still failing (known issue)
- ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: Database operations functional via Supabase client

### Immediate Action Required
1. **Database Connection Fix**: Need to resolve postgres-js + Supabase pooler compatibility
2. **Alternative Approach**: Consider switching to Supabase client for all database operations
3. **Connection String**: May need direct connection instead of pooler

### Impact on Migration Timeline
- Phase 3 (Frontend Integration) can proceed with Supabase client
- Authentication flow testing now possible
- Phase 4 (Vercel Deployment) preparation can continue
- **Status**: UNBLOCKED with alternative approach

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **PRIORITY**: Replace Drizzle ORM calls with Supabase client in storage layer
2. Test authentication endpoints with working database connection
3. Continue Phase 3 frontend integration with functional backend
4. Keep Drizzle schema for type safety, but use Supabase client for operations
5. Consider hybrid approach: Supabase client for CRUD, Drizzle for complex queries

## 2025-01-31 - Vercel Serverless Migration: Authentication Infrastructure Complete

### Changes Made
- Created comprehensive serverless authentication infrastructure for Vercel deployment
- Implemented JWT authentication middleware with Supabase integration
- Built serverless-compatible storage layer using Supabase client
- Created error handling utilities and API response standardization
- Added development utilities and sample data management
- Established type compatibility layer for serverless functions

### Files Created
- `lib/auth.ts` - JWT authentication middleware and validation utilities
- `lib/errorHandler.ts` - Centralized error handling for serverless functions
- `lib/storage.ts` - Serverless storage layer using Supabase client
- `lib/utils.ts` - Common utilities for serverless operations
- `lib/types.ts` - Type compatibility layer for API functions
- `lib/sampleData.ts` - Development sample data utilities

### Impact
The serverless authentication infrastructure is now complete and ready for implementing individual API endpoints. The system provides:
- JWT token validation with Supabase auth
- Role-based access control with hierarchical permissions
- Serverless-optimized database operations
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Development mode support with sample data

### Next Steps
- Begin implementing authentication API endpoints as serverless functions
- Convert existing Express routes to individual serverless functions
- Update frontend to work with new JWT-based authentication

 2025-01-31 - Vercel Deployment Preparation

### Changes Made
- Created `vercel.json` configuration for serverless deployment
- Updated `api/index.ts` to work with Vercel's serverless functions
- Modified build scripts in `package.json` for Vercel compatibility
- Added `vercel-build` script for static build process

### Files Modified
- `vercel.json` - New Vercel deployment configuration
- `api/index.ts` - Updated for serverless function compatibility
- `package.json` - Modified build scripts for Vercel

### Impact
Initial Vercel configuration is in place, but the codebase still needs significant restructuring for full serverless compatibility. The current Express server architecture needs to be adapted for Vercel's serverless functions.

### Issues Identified
- Express server architecture not compatible with Vercel serverless
- Session management needs adaptation for stateless functions
- Route structure needs individual API endpoints
- Build configuration requires refinement

### Next Steps
- Restructure API routes for individual serverless functions
- Implement stateless authentication approach
- Test deployment on Vercel
- Refine build and routing configuration
